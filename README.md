# Day_Planner
This homework assignment required students to utilize the third-party API, Moment.js, to create a daily planner that allows a user to add and store events to help effectively manage time. The deployed web application displays the current day at the top of the planner. When the user scrolls down, they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours (9am - 5pm) that they can click on and fill with various events. The time blocks are color coded as grey, red, and green to indicate past, present, and future, respectively. When a user enters an event into the text field of a time block, that event is saved in local storage for the user to access again if the page is refreshed.
